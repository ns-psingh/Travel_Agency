This is the Travel Agency Application for my Data Structures assignment.
The application is at a very basic level and does not have any high-tech algorithm. It uses the graph data structure for represting the 
network of airports and the flights connecting them. Other than that the app allows users to send feedback and queries to the administrator
regarding any problems in the app using Circular queue implemented using linked lists. The app stored the user information of users in the form 
of linked lists.
